# My (long overdue) personal website :)

This uses React + TypeScript so install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) first before trying to build.

WebGL2 is used for the background.

This website is deployed via Cloudflare Pages, and will automatically build/deploy the `main` branch to `benjxia.dev` on pushes.


# Development

This website uses React for frontend and Vite for building.

1. Install Dependencies

### ```npm install```

2. To run a development server on `localhost:3000`

### ```npm run dev```

For linting, run `npm run lint`.

3. To create a production build

### ```npm run build```

4. To preview the latest production build

### ```npm run preview```
